          But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's
          over. Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told
          like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't talk about that.' Bull
          s.h.i.t. ... uh .... Because I'm just ... um .... I don't know. Why
          give an interview when you can leave a warning, you know? And people
          say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through your resentments.'
          Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack.
          And the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do his job,
          which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above the law.
          Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it.

          So ... you know ... within that is tremendous focus, and tremendous
          clarity, and tremendous peace. And therefore there's nothing in the
          middle. I don't live in the middle anymore. That's where you get ts
          ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where
          that goes. .... And then, I just got to add this: There was a whole
          firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew.
          And let me just say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where
          there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good
          luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly... So ....

          Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it. They have zero. They have
          that night, and I will forget about them as the last image of them
          exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and they will
          sell me, and they will lose.

          Yes! I don't read anything after it's come out, because I will not
          waste my precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand,
          according to you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican
          assassins. Yes! I don't read anything after it's come out, because I

          But I dare anyone to debate me on things. And you know, I'm tired ...
          I'm so tired of pretending like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and
          just winning every second .... And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and
          just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn. Debate me on AA
          right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with
          my mind. But I dare anyone to debate me on things. 100%. You know,
          here's your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. Yeah, why
          not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms.

        <p>
          Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to
          completely discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I
          to get your mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the
          trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon complete and total
          surrender ... or the concept of complete and total surrender. No, you
          won't get high .... It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit
          panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment.
